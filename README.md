## Project Scope and Goals

Using data from the CAES institute, we want to make a [native language inference/identification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native-language_identification) system that would attempt to classify a persons native language based on how they write a second language. We are using data from a Spanish Language test, with participants that spoke Chinese, Portuguese, Russian, French, English, and Arabic. 

## Challenges 

Unfortunately, the data that we have is not very rich. We are working with essays that were then transcribed into part of speech tags, rather than raw essays. This makes working with the text easier because it is standardized; however, it also limits the amount of data that we can gather from the text. 

## Applications 

One application of NLI is its use in forensic linguistics. With the rise of Russian troll farms, being able to accurately determine which texts were written by native language speakers versus which texts were written by native Russian speakers would turn the tide of misinformation and propaganda that has flooded the internet. 

## Other work

This work is based on research from a few shared tasks. Here are links to further reading:
